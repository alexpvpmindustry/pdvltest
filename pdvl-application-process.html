  <div class="mdc-typography text-block">
    <p>If you're interested in becoming a private hire car driver in Singapore, you'll need to apply for a Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licence (PDVL). Here are the steps involved in the application process:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Meet the eligibility requirements: To be eligible for a PDVL, you must be at least 30 years old and have at least 1 year of driving experience in Singapore.</li>
      <li>Complete the training course: You'll need to complete a 10-hour training course on private hire car driving and regulations. You can take the course from any of the 3 approved training providers in Singapore.</li>
      <li>Submit the application form: You'll need to fill out and submit the PDVL application form, which is available online or in person at the Land Transport Authority (LTA) office.</li>
      <li>Provide the necessary documentation: You'll need to provide a recent passport-sized photograph, a copy of your NRIC or passport, and your driving licence. If you're a foreigner, you'll also need to provide proof of residency in Singapore.</li>
      <li>Pay the application fee: You'll need to pay a non-refundable application fee of S$40 when you submit your application.</li>
      <li>Attend the medical check-up: You'll need to undergo a medical check-up at a clinic approved by the LTA to ensure you're fit to drive.</li>
      <li>Wait for the outcome: The LTA will process your application and notify you of the outcome within 4-6 weeks.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If your application is approved, you'll need to attend a briefing session and collect your PDVL from the LTA office. You'll also need to obtain commercial motor insurance and install a tamper-evident decal on your vehicle.</p>
    <p>Good luck with your application!</p>
