    This code creates a simple web page with a heading element displaying the initial countdown time of 10 minutes, and
    a button that starts the timer when clicked.

    When the startTimer() function is called, it creates a countDownDate variable representing the time when the
    countdown should end (in this case, 10 minutes from the current time). It then sets up an interval using the
    setInterval() function, which runs every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).

    Within the interval, it calculates the remaining time left in the countdown by subtracting the current time from the
    countDownDate variable. It then formats the remaining time into minutes and seconds, and updates the text of the
    heading element with the new time.

    If the remaining time is less than zero (i.e. the countdown has expired), it clears the interval and updates the
    text of the heading element to display "EXPIRED".

    This is just a basic example, and you can customize the timer to suit your needs by adjusting the starting time,
    formatting, and behavior when the countdown expires.
