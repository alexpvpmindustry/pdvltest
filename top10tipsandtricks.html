    <h3>Tip 1</h3>
    <p>Understand the test format: Familiarize yourself with the test format, which consists of multiple-choice
      questions with four options. Knowing the format can help you understand how to approach the questions.
    <h3>Tip 2</h3>
    </p>
    <p>Study the official PDVL handbook: The official PDVL handbook contains all the information you need to know for
      the test. Study the handbook thoroughly and make notes if needed.
    <h3>Tip 3</h3>
    </p>
    <p>Practice with sample questions: There are many sample questions available online that you can practice with. This
      will help you get a feel for the type of questions that will be asked.
    <h3>Tip 4</h3>
    </p>
    <p>Read each question carefully: Take the time to read each question carefully, paying attention to the details.
      Don't rush through the questions.
    <h3>Tip 5</h3>
    </p>
    <p>Eliminate incorrect options: If you are unsure of the answer, eliminate the options that you know are incorrect.
      This will increase your chances of choosing the correct answer.
    <h3>Tip 6</h3>
    </p>
    <p>Use logic: Use logic to help you choose the correct answer. Sometimes, even if you don't know the answer, you can
      make an educated guess based on logic.
    <h3>Tip 7</h3>
    </p>
    <p>Don't overthink: Sometimes, the answer to a question is straightforward, so don't overthink it. Trust your
      instincts and go with the answer that feels right.
    <h3>Tip 8</h3>
    </p>
    <p>Manage your time: The PDVL test is timed, so it's important to manage your time wisely. Don't spend too much time
      on one question, as you might run out of time for other questions.
    <h3>Tip 9</h3>
    </p>
    <p>Stay calm and focused: The test can be stressful, but it's important to stay calm and focused. Take deep breaths
      and try to relax.
    </p>
    <h3>Tip 10</h3>
    <p>Review your answers: Once you have completed the test, review your answers. This will give you the opportunity to
      correct any mistakes you may have made.
    </p>
